Encountered Problems :
-- check input type
-- string read command
-- destructor memory leak
-- getting last participants 
-- manage non participating drivers in a race

Solutions :
-- sstream
-- stoi
-- every time when I created a new cell in skiplist I saved it s address in a array and afeter I deleted whole array
-- i saved in last and last_ant the participants from last print and last race
-- result.search() will check even from order of winners from last race and update
-- every time a driver got 0 time I set it s entry in Skiplist near +oo and precessed only for drivers-nulled

Serendipity :
-- no need for clear the skipList, just use destructor
